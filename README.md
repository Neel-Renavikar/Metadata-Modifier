# Pdf_metaeditor
A web application that reads the metadata from pdf documents and modifies the metadata.

EDITING PDF METADATA:-
a) The pdfs are uploaded into a server folder named as 'uploads'.
b) The tool uses FPDI and FPDF libraries to create a duplicate pdf and storing the new pdf to 'store' folder in the server.
c) The pdf stored in the 'store' folder has the pdf with new metadata.

Coded in php and html , this project is still a work in progress!
